# Automatic Tuning 2017

Pass Summit 2017 Summary Presentation - SQL Server 2017 Automatic Tuning

## Getting Started

This demo should work on any machine running SQL Server 2017.

It assumes you have restored the WideWorldImporters sample database on a SQL Server 2017 instance. 

2017 Automatic Tuning: (requirements: perfmon, sqlcmd, ostress.exe, sql2017, wwi db)

C:\Deployments\demo3_sqlserverkeepsyoufast\ 

wwi db (see latest release WideWorldImporters-Full.bak [121 MB]): https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/tree/master/samples/databases/wide-world-importers

### Prerequisites

Powershell/Cmd, Perfmon, sqlcmd, ostress.exe, SQL Server 2017, WideWorldImporters database.

### Installing

Install SQL Server 2017 on your local machine. I recommend choosing Developer Edition for the purpose of this demo:  https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads

Install RML Utilities: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/944837/description-of-the-replay-markup-language-rml-utilities-for-sql-server

```
Copy ostress.exe into C:\Deployments\demo3_sqlserverkeepsyoufast 
```

Download latest release [WideWorldImporters-Full.bak [121 MB]](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/tree/master/samples/databases/wide-world-importers) and restore it. (If you already have you may skip this step)

See file: [restore_wwi.sql](https://github.com/hfleitas/AutomaticTuning2017/blob/master/AutomaticTuning2017/restore_wwi.sql)

```
--verify
restore filelistonly from disk = 'c:\users\hfleitas\downloads\wideworldimporters-full.bak'
go 
--set your own paths
restore database [WideWordImporters] from disk = 'c:\users\hfleitas\downloads\wideworldimporters-full.bak'
with move 'wwi_primary' to 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL13.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\DATA\wideworldimporters.mdf' 
,move 'wwi_userdata' to 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL13.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\DATA\wideworldimporters_userdata.ndf'
,move 'wwi_log' to 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL13.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\DATA\wideworldimporters.ldf'
,move 'wwi_inmemory_data_1' to 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL13.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\DATA\wideworldimporters_inmemory_data_1'
,stats = 25
go
--rollup compat to 2017
alter database [WideWordImporters] set compatibility_level = 140
go
--update stats
use [WideWordImporters]
go
EXEC sp_updatestats
```

1. Run the script [setup.sql](https://github.com/hfleitas/AutomaticTuning2017/blob/master/AutomaticTuning2017/setup.sql) to install some stored procedures in the WideWorldImporters database

```
USE [master]
GO
ALTER DATABASE [WideWorldImporters] SET QUERY_STORE = ON
GO
ALTER DATABASE [WideWorldImporters] SET QUERY_STORE (OPERATION_MODE = READ_WRITE)
GO
ALTER DATABASE current SET AUTOMATIC_TUNING ( FORCE_LAST_GOOD_PLAN = ON); --THIS IS THE MAGIC!

```

2. Walk through the steps in [demo-full.sql](https://github.com/hfleitas/AutomaticTuning2017/blob/master/AutomaticTuning2017/demo-full.sql) to show how Auto Plan Correction Works

3. Bring up the Query Store Reports for Queries with Forced Plans to see how the plan was changed and how we forced the faster one


End with state on FLGP is ON:

```
SELECT name, desired_state_desc, actual_state_desc, reason_desc FROM sys.database_automatic_tuning_options;
```

## Running the tests
Â 
PowerShell window 1:

```
.\report.cmd
```

PowerShell window 2:

```
perfom ## performance monitor, added SQLServer:SQL Statistics:Batch Requests/sec. 
.\repro_setup.cmd
.\initialize.cmd
.\auto_tune.cmd
.\regression.cmd
```

### Purpose

This test will illustrate a regression of batch requests per second due to a new compiled execution plan with parameter sniffing, and will force the last good plan by automatically Tuning SQL Server to resolve the regression. The intention is to relieve the reactive emergency/oncall support model by aliviating a need for manual intervention. It's advisable to monitor the system for forced plans and revist why there occurred to prevent the issue if possible.
